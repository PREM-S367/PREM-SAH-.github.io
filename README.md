Hey there 👋 I’m Prem Sah, a Computer Engineer from Nepal. This is my personal website — part portfolio, part playground, and part “look what I can do with code.”

I built this site to share my projects, highlight my skills, and give you a glimpse into what I’m working on (and occasionally, what I break while experimenting 🛠️).

Whether you’re here to check out my work, learn about my journey, or just to judge my design choices — welcome aboard 🚀
